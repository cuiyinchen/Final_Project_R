# R_Project
School Project - Optimize the Netflix Homepage by Minimizing Customer Browsing Time
## Purpose
The goal of the experiment is to minimize the average time for Netflix users to browse
the homepage, and thus improve the user viscosity using R. 
## Phases
In order to study how to reduce the average browsing time of the Netflix homepage, we
divide the experiment into three phases.
## Phase 1
Phase 1 is factor screening. The goal of Phase 1 is to find the significant factors, and
remove the insignificant ones.
## Phase 2
Phase 2 is to find the optimal regions using the method of steepest descent (MSD).
## Phase 3
Phase 3 is to find the optimal point by conducting central component design (CCD) and using
a second order response surface model (RSM). The estimated 95% confidence interval
for the expected browsing time is also predicted in this phase.
